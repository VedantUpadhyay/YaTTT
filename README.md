This is kind of my entry into AI searching algorithms and Game Theory!
Currently this Tic-Tac-Toe game allows human players to: -
  1. Choose player X or O
  2. Choose level of difficulty: -
     Easy
     Medium
     Hard
     IMPOSSIBLE

     *Search depth constraints facilitate the difficulty levels game-playing!
